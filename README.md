# GRADIAN
Grain Recognition and Analysis Device with InstAnt Notification is a project which main goal is to recognize differents kinds of grains in a food plant industry. To do this, it uses the [AS7341 11-Channel Spectral Sensor](https://ams-osram.com/products/sensors/ambient-light-color-spectral-proximity-sensors/ams-as7341-11-channel-spectral-color-sensor) to get the raw data of each sample. The data is latter normalized and then processed with three models of classification algorithms, consequently showing the result of the given data vector. Additionaly, the results of the prediction can be physically compared with a picture taken by the [Raspberry Pi V1.3 5MP Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html).
